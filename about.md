I'm Jack. I love art and all things tech. That's why I built [a robot that does art]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/minus-e/).

At the moment, I work as an arts instructor of [Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). What that means is that I help students figure their things out while still trying to figure things out in my own life.

Oh, by the way, I cook in my spare time. You can find photos of some of my cooking [here]().

[Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv)'s my CV, or drop me a line at [hi@jackbdu.com](mailto:hi@jackbdu.com). I'm always happy to talk to new people and be inspired :)
